## Features

- **Data Fetching:** Retrieves posts using React Query's `useQuery` hook.
- **Caching:** Implements automatic data caching to reduce redundant network requests.
- **Error Handling:** Handles errors gracefully with user-friendly messages.
- **Manual Refetching:** Includes a button to trigger data refetching on demand.
